# Python Projects

This repository is a curated collection of my Python-based projects built using **Django**, **Django REST Framework (DRF)**, and other Python libraries.  
It showcases a mix of web applications, APIs, and utility scripts, reflecting practical use cases and clean coding practices.

## âœ¨ Highlights
- **Django Web Apps** â€“ Full-featured applications with robust backend logic.
- **REST APIs with DRF** â€“ Scalable, well-documented API implementations.
- **Utility Scripts** â€“ Small but powerful tools for automation and productivity.
- **Best Practices** â€“ Code structured for readability, reusability, and maintainability.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database:** SQLite / PostgreSQL
- **Frontend (where applicable):** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Other Tools:** Pip, Virtualenv
